          <h2>Leader of the Indian National Army (Azad Hind Fauj)</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Subhash Chandra Bose (1897–1945)</b>, fondly known as Netaji, was
            a pivotal, fiery leader in India's struggle for independence. Born
            in Cuttack, he was highly educated, clearing the ICS exam before
            choosing to fight against British rule. Though initially in
            Congress, he favored more militant, radical methods, famously
            breaking with Gandhi to later form the Forward Bloc. During WWII, he
            took a daring journey to Europe to seek help, eventually creating
            the Indian National Army (INA) with Japanese aid to fight for
            liberation from Southeast Asia. His iconic slogan, “Give me blood,
            and I shall give you freedom,” rallied thousands of Indians, both at
            home and abroad. As a brilliant strategist and passionate
            nationalist, he remains a revered hero. His bold actions,
            particularly the INA’s march toward India, dramatically accelerated
            the end of British rule. His legacy as a fearless patriot remains an
            inspiration, advocating for a free, sovereign India.
